 A wrapper for ripgrep
 Ripgrep is required to be installed
 You may put the script and the regexp folder wherever you want, they don't have to be together.
 Simply change the path of regexp at line 1 in the script.
 And after giving the chmod +x /path/to/chksens.sh
 Just type the command below in the dir full of the files for which you want to check sensitive content that would be matched by the rules in the regexp folder.
 ```
 /path/to/chksens.sh
 ```
 And see the result.
 Enjoy, if you have any question plz post a issue.
